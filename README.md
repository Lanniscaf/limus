## Introduction

Remember those fancy rotated pictures of app screenshots that you saw? Well, I find it very inconvenient to do all that transforming on Photoshop or similar tools. Therefore, I created this tool to help you transform you screenshots/images faster.

## How to use?

All you need to do is to access the app [here](https://limus.netlify.app/). Then, follow a short tutorial to explore how you can use this tool:

## Features

#### Rotate

By adjusting the `x`, `y`, `z` rotation parameter, you can rotate you image to the angle that you desire.

#### Scaling

When you first upload the image, you might find it too big or too small for your shot, that's because Limus display image using its' true size without scaling. However, you can choose to scale up or down the picture using the `Image scale` slider.

#### Drop shadow

Having a shadow drop can be very convenient when you have a image that can blend in with the background. With Limus, you have the option adjust the shadow `y` position as well as how blury you want your shadow to be.

#### Different types of background

With Limus, you can also change the background of the shot from a plain color background to transparent background or even using an image as a background!

#### Free transform

If you having trouble adjusting your image with the `x`, `y`, `z` rotation sliders, you can always hold the `Shift` key and the app with go into `free transform` mode and you can freely rotate your image by dragging the image using your mouse.

Since I'm still young, dumb, and broke, I have to give [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) a big thank you for offering a free plan and hosting this app. Although the app domain is not very professional, but I'll try to get a better domain once I receive more attention of the community and have sponsorships.
